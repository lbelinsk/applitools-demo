> I'm working on adding Applitools Github Pull Request integration to a repository that already has baselines.
I need your assistance to copy my existing baselines so that test that run in CI will be synchronised with Applitools' existing baselines.<br/>
> The name of the repository that I’m working on is - <repository_name>, and I need you to copy all the baselines from the “default” branch to the "<repository_name>/master” branch.<br/>
> Thanks a lot.
